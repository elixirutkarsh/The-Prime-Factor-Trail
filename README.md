# The-Prime-Factor-Trail
You are given a positive integer, and your task is to determine the prime factors of that number. However, you can only ask questions in the form of "Is X a factor of the number?" where X is any positive integer. You can only ask a limited number of questions.

Solution:
To find the prime factors of the given number, follow these steps:

Start with the number 2 and ask, "Is 2 a factor of the number?"
a. If the answer is yes, then 2 is a prime factor. Repeat this step until the answer is no.
b. If the answer is no, move to the next number.

Proceed to the next prime number, which is 3, and ask, "Is 3 a factor of the number?"
a. If the answer is yes, then 3 is a prime factor. Repeat this step until the answer is no.
b. If the answer is no, move to the next prime number.

Continue this process, asking about prime numbers in increasing order until the number itself is reached. By asking questions about prime numbers, you can determine the prime factors of the given number within the limited number of questions allowed.
